## 2. Project Description

RoomSync is a comprehensive roommate management application designed to streamline the process of connecting with and living harmoniously with roommates. The app addresses common challenges in shared living situations by providing tools for communication, task management, and accountability through a rating system.

The application targets university students, young professionals, and anyone seeking or currently residing in a shared accommodation. RoomSync facilitates the entire roommate lifecycle– from viewing roommates track records to pick a ‘good roommate’, through creating a space to encourage communication and task coordination, to providing feedback and ranking that helps build trustworthy roommate profiles for future living arrangements.
