## 3. Requirements Specification

### **3.1. List of Features**

**User Authentication** - Secure user sign up or login using Google authentication service.

**User Profile Management** - An user must fill out all mandatory fields (section a), upon user profile creation. Users can also choose to fill out optional fields (section b). Editable fields can be changed anytime in the user management page whereas non-editable fields can't be changed after account creation. User profiles can be shared for housing/roommate applications

- **Mandatory/Not editable (kept private)**
  - Name (Legal first and last name)
  - DOB
  - Gender
  - Email (this will be automatically filled out after creating an account through Google user authentication)
- **Optional/editable**
  - Bio
  - Profile picture
  - Living preference/expectations (ex. morning/night person, drinking, partying, noise, profession/student)

**Group Management** – Users have an option to either create a new group or join an existing group.

- **Create Group**: Must enter group name (editable) and a unique group (not editable) code will be created. This group code can be shared.
- **Join Group**: Users can enter a unique group code to join a group.
- **Maximum 8 users in a group**: Additional users will be unable attempt to join group
- **View Group**: See group members profiles, name of group and each member's move-in date/group join date.
- **Leave Group**: Any user part of a group can leave the group. When the owner leaves, ownership automatically transfers to the oldest member (by join date). If the owner is the only member, the group is deleted.

**Group Communication** - Real-time messaging system with all group members. Integrated polling functionality to block certain times on the calendar for group decisions with default options: yes or no. Polls will expire within a week.

**Group Task Management** - Algorithmic task assignment and tracking system for household responsibilities

- **View Tasks**: Three view options - Calendar View (tasks by selected date), Weekly View (all group tasks grouped by day), My Tasks (personal tasks grouped by day).
- **Set Task Status**: Default status is 'incomplete'. Users can update to 'in-progress' or 'completed'.
- **Create Task**: Enter task name, optional description, difficulty (1-5), recurrence (one-time/daily/weekly/bi-weekly/monthly), required people (1-10), deadline (for one-time tasks), and optional member assignment.
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks assigned weekly via algorithm for fair distribution, or manually assigned at creation to specific members.

**Roommate Rating System** - Users can rate roommate experience after living with them for a minimum of 30 days.

- **Rating** - Reputation score: Users can give their roommates a score out of 5 and leave comments and testimonies to describe their personal living experience
- While bad roomates might be able to delete account or not have one, it is still a good way for good roommates to build up a track record of cleanliness for future rooms. This has been proven to work like Ebay or Facebook marketplace.

**User Moderation** - Automated content moderation using LLM

- Users can report inappropriate behavior. The system analyzes the reported user's recent messages (up to 100) using OpenAI to determine if content violates community standards (harassment, hate speech, threats, etc.).
- If deemed offensive, the user is flagged in the database (isOffensive field set to true).

### **3.2. Use Case Diagram**

![Use Case Diagram](./images/UseCaseDiagram.jpg)

### **3.3. Actors Description**

**Human Actors:**

1. **Non-Group Member**: A registered user who is not currently part of any roommate group. Can create and edit their profile, create new groups, and join existing groups through invitation codes. Cannot access group-specific features like chat, task management, or rating systems since these require active group membership.

2. **Group Member**: A registered user who belongs to a roommate group but is not the group owner. Has access to all group features including group chat, polling, task management (viewing and completing assigned tasks), viewing other group members' profiles, and rating roommates (must have lived together for minimum 30 days). Can leave the group voluntarily but cannot remove other members or delete the group.

3. **Group Owner**: A group member with additional administrative privileges. Can perform all group member functions plus remove other group members from the group and delete the entire group. When leaving the group will transfer ownership to the oldest other group member. Also has rating privileges for roommates they have lived with for the required minimum period.

**External System Actors:**

4. **Google OAuth 2.0 API**: External authentication service that verifies user identity during account creation (use case 1) and login (use case 2). The system interacts with this API to validate Google ID tokens and retrieve user email and name information. This is a required external dependency for user authentication.

### **3.6. Screen Mock-ups**

### **3.7. Non-Functional Requirements**

<a name="nfr1"></a>
1. **API Response Time Requirement**
   - **Description**: API response times for login, signup (with all required data entered), message send (not downstream message delivery), and user profile fetch must be under 200ms on Wi-Fi 5+ connection on a 16GB Android phone running Android API 33.
   - **Justification**: According to UPCore Technologies' mobile app performance research, slow response times are universally detrimental to user sentiment, engagement, conversions, and churn. Leading mobile apps deliver response times under 300ms consistently, with 100ms or less optimal for interactions. Degraded response times are symptoms of sluggish code and infrastructure. To ensure end-to-end user experience remains under the 300ms threshold for perceived responsiveness, API latency must be kept under 200ms to account for network overhead, client-side rendering, and processing time. This 200ms target allows for a 100ms buffer for UI updates and animations while staying within the critical 300ms window that maintains user flow and prevents perceived lag.
   - **Testing Method**: Timing starts when sending a cURL request to the API with required parameters and ends when receiving a 200 OK response from the server. Error responses (400s, 500s) are excluded from measurements as optimization should target successful operations.

<a name="nfr2"></a>
2. **Application Load Time Requirement**
   - **Description**: The application cold start (launching app when not in memory) must complete within 5 seconds on a 16GB Android phone running Android API 33 on Wi-Fi 5-7 connection.
   - **Justification**: According to App Institute's responsiveness research, app load time is a critical metric for user retention. Users expect immediate access to functionality, and delays during cold start create negative first impressions and increase abandonment rates. The 5-second threshold is based on industry benchmarks for productivity apps, balancing the need for quick startup with the complexity of initializing authentication, database connections, and UI components. This ensures users can access core features (group chat, tasks) quickly enough for time-sensitive household coordination scenarios (e.g., coordinating grocery runs, responding to locked-out roommates).
   - **Testing Method**: Time measurement begins when the app icon is tapped on the Android home screen (with app not in memory) and ends when the user can interact with the first screen (login screen for new users, home dashboard for authenticated users).

<a name="nfr3"></a>
3. **UI Accessibility Requirement**
   - **Description**: All interactive buttons and touch targets must have a minimum touch target size of 42x42 pixels to ensure accessibility and ease of use.
   - **Justification**: According to UX Movement's mobile usability research on optimal button sizing and spacing, smaller buttons increase error rates and user frustration, particularly for users with motor impairments, larger fingers, or when using the app in motion (walking between rooms). The 42-pixel minimum is based on empirical studies showing this size provides adequate touch accuracy across diverse user populations without requiring excessive screen space. This is critical for RoomSync's core interactions (sending messages, marking tasks complete, creating polls) which users often perform quickly while multitasking in shared living spaces.
   - **Testing Method**: Automated accessibility testing using Android Accessibility Scanner to verify all button components meet the 42x42 pixel minimum touch target size requirement.

### **4.2. Databases**

1. **MongoDB**
   - **Purpose**: Stores persistent data for the application, including user profiles, group information, tasks, chat history, ratings, and moderation reports. MongoDB's document-based model supports dynamic schemas, which is suitable for evolving profile structures, group data, and task allocation.
   - **Collections**:
     - **Users**: email (unique), name, googleId (unique), dob, gender (Male/Female/Prefer-not-to-say), profileComplete (boolean), bio (max 500 chars), profilePicture (URL), averageRating (0-5), livingPreferences (schedule: Morning/Night/Flexible, drinking: None/Occasional/Regular, partying: None/Occasional/Regular, noise: Quiet/Moderate/Loud, profession: Student/Worker/Unemployed), groupName, isOffensive (boolean for moderation flag)
     - **Groups**: name (max 100 chars), groupCode (unique 4-char alphanumeric), owner (User reference), members (array of {userId: User reference, joinDate: Date, moveInDate: Date})
     - **Messages**: groupId (Group reference), senderId (User reference), content (max 1000 chars), type (text/poll), pollData (for polls: question max 200 chars, options array max 100 chars each, votes array with {userId, option, timestamp}, expiresAt: Date default 7 days), createdAt timestamp.
     - **Tasks**: name (max 100 chars), description (max 500 chars), groupId (Group reference), createdBy (User reference), difficulty (1-5 integer), recurrence (daily/weekly/bi-weekly/monthly/one-time), requiredPeople (1-10 integer), deadline (Date, required for one-time tasks), assignments (array of {userId: User reference, weekStart: Date, status: incomplete/in-progress/completed, completedAt: Date}).
     - **Ratings**: ratedUserId (User reference), raterUserId (User reference), groupId (Group reference), rating (1-5 integer), testimonial (max 500 chars), timeSpentMinutes (auto-calculated from group join dates), createdAt timestamp. Unique constraint on (ratedUserId, raterUserId, groupId) to prevent duplicate ratings.

### **4.3. External Modules**

External modules are third-party services accessed over the internet that provide functionality not implemented within the RoomSync application.

1. **Google OAuth 2.0 API**
   - **Provider**: Google Identity Platform
   - **Purpose**: Provides secure authentication and identity verification. Allows users to sign up and log in using their existing Google accounts without requiring password management in the RoomSync system.
   - **Integration**: Used via google-auth-library npm package. The Android client obtains an ID token from Google Sign-In, which is sent to the Node.js backend for verification against Google's servers.
   - **Data Exchanged**: Receives user's email, name, and unique Google ID upon successful authentication.

2. **LLM Moderation System (MVP Feature)**
   - **Provider**: OpenAI API (accessed via OpenRouter)
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes reported user behavior by reviewing message history to detect harassment, hate speech, threats, sexual harassment, and other violations.
   - **Integration**: Used via OpenAI npm package with OpenRouter proxy. When a user is reported, the system fetches up to 100 recent messages from the reported user and sends them to GPT-3.5-turbo with a moderation prompt. The LLM returns a JSON response indicating whether the content is offensive.
   - **Data Exchanged**: Sends message content and reporter's reason; receives JSON response with isOffensive boolean.
   - **Action**: If flagged as offensive, the user's isOffensive field is set to true in the database.

### **4.4. Frameworks and Libraries**

Frameworks and libraries are software packages that provide reusable functionality and are integrated into the application codebase, as opposed to external APIs which are accessed over the network.

**Front-End (Android/Kotlin):**

1. **Jetpack Compose**
   - **Type**: Android UI Framework
   - **Purpose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces. Provides composable functions for creating layouts, managing state, and handling user interactions.
   - **Reason**: Required by course assignment. Replaces legacy XML-based Views with a more maintainable Kotlin-based approach. Integrates seamlessly with Kotlin coroutines and ensures API 33 compatibility.

2. **Retrofit**
   - **Type**: HTTP Client Library
   - **Purpose**: Type-safe REST client for Android that handles HTTP requests to the Node.js backend. Converts API responses to Kotlin data classes automatically.
   - **Usage**: Defines interface (ApiService.kt) with annotations like @POST("api/auth/login") to call backend endpoints.

3. **Kotlin Coroutines**
   - **Type**: Concurrency Library
   - **Purpose**: Manages asynchronous operations (network calls, database queries) without blocking the UI thread. All Retrofit API calls use suspend functions for non-blocking execution.

4. **Navigation Compose**
   - **Type**: Navigation Framework
   - **Purpose**: Handles screen navigation and routing in Jetpack Compose. Manages navigation graph and backstack.
   - **Usage**: Defines routes (NavRoutes.AUTH, NavRoutes.HOME, etc.) and handles navigation between screens with type-safe arguments.

5. **Socket.IO Client**
   - **Type**: Real-Time Communication Library
   - **Purpose**: Enables WebSocket connections from Android client to backend server for real-time chat message delivery.
   - **Usage**: Connects to backend Socket.IO server, listens for "new-message" events, and updates UI in real-time.

6. **Coil**
   - **Type**: Image Loading Library
   - **Purpose**: Asynchronously loads and caches images (profile pictures) in Compose UI. Kotlin-first library optimized for Jetpack Compose.
   - **Usage**: AsyncImage composable to load profile pictures from URLs with placeholder and error handling.

7. **Google Play Services Auth**
   - **Type**: Authentication Library
   - **Purpose**: Provides Google Sign-In functionality on Android. Generates Google ID tokens for OAuth authentication.
   - **Usage**: Launches Google Sign-In intent, receives ID token, and sends to backend for verification.

**Back-End (Node.js/TypeScript):**

8. **Express.js**
   - **Type**: Web Application Framework
   - **Purpose**: Lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs in Node.js. Handles routing, middleware, request/response processing, and HTTP server management.
   - **Usage**: All API routes (/api/auth, /api/group, /api/task, etc.) are defined using Express routers.

9. **Mongoose**
   - **Type**: Object Document Mapper (ODM) Library
   - **Purpose**: Provides schema-based modeling layer for MongoDB. Defines data structures, validation rules, and relationships between collections. Integrates TypeScript types with database operations.
   - **Usage**: Models for User, Group, Task, Message, and Rating define the database schema and provide query methods.

10. **Socket.IO**
   - **Type**: Real-Time Communication Library
   - **Purpose**: Enables bidirectional WebSocket connections between server and Android clients for instant message delivery. Automatically falls back to HTTP long-polling if WebSockets are unavailable.
   - **Usage**: Broadcasts new messages to all clients in a group room using io.to(groupId).emit('new-message', data).

11. **JSON Web Token (jsonwebtoken)**
   - **Type**: Authentication Library
   - **Purpose**: Generates and verifies JWT tokens for stateless authentication. Tokens are signed with HS256 algorithm and include user ID payload.
   - **Usage**: After Google OAuth verification, server issues a JWT that clients include in the Authorization header for protected routes.

12. **google-auth-library**
   - **Type**: Google Authentication Client Library
   - **Purpose**: Verifies Google OAuth ID tokens received from the Android client. Validates token signatures against Google's public keys.
   - **Usage**: verifyIdToken() method extracts user email, name, and Google ID from tokens.

13. **OpenAI**
   - **Type**: AI/LLM Integration Library
   - **Purpose**: Provides access to OpenAI's GPT models for content moderation. Analyzes reported user messages to detect violations.
   - **Usage**: Used via OpenRouter proxy to send message batches to GPT-3.5-turbo for automated moderation analysis, returns JSON with isOffensive boolean.

**Programming Languages:**

- **Kotlin**: Statically-typed JVM language for Android development. Required by course assignment. Provides null safety, coroutines, and modern functional programming features.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed superset of JavaScript for backend development. Required by course assignment. Provides compile-time type checking and enhanced IDE support.

**Runtime Environments:**

- **Android Runtime (ART)**: Executes Kotlin bytecode on Android devices (API 33 minimum).
- **Node.js v18+**: JavaScript runtime for executing TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript) on the server.

**Database:**

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL document database storing all persistent application data in JSON-like BSON format. Collections include Users, Groups, Messages, Tasks, and Ratings. On Atlas exactly like localhost ie no other features being used.

**Cloud Infrastructure:**

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Cloud infrastructure provider hosting the Node.js backend and MongoDB database on Compute Engine VMs. Provides scalable, reliable infrastructure with 99.95% uptime SLA. Required by course assignment.

```


### **4.7. Design of Non-Functional Requirements**

1. [**API Response Time Requirement**](#nfr1)
   - **Implementation**: The code is optimized to minimize unnecessary API calls between the front and backend to reduce API latency, keeping response times under 200ms. In the backend, to accelerate look ups and searches for users or groups, rather than using entire user fields, we only search for them according to their email or id, reducing query time and payload size.

2. [**UI Accessibility Requirement**](#nfr3)
   - **Implementation**: We use three types of buttons in our code, Button, IconButton, and FloatingActionButton. Each button has a size of 48 or 56 dp/pixels which ensures that the button is visible to the user at all times, even on smaller screens, making the buttons easy to access and meeting the requirement that all buttons should be at least 42 pixels.

3. [**Application Load Time Requirement**](#nfr2)
   - **Implementation**: To ensure the app loads within 5 seconds, we organized and sectioned off our code so that only critical screens are loaded first while non essential resources such as images are loaded asynchronously. By making sure we have minimal startup dependencies, such that onCreate(), only essential tasks are loaded. This ensures efficient cold start performance.
