Project
A major part of the course is the development project. The project simulates real development settings, where development teams communicate with customers to implement software that satisfies the customers’ requirements. The intent of this project is to give you the opportunity to apply the course concepts to a real system.

Scope: You are required to develop a client-server software system with the client (front-end) running on a mobile device and the server (back-end) running in the cloud. Several examples of reasonably-scoped projects can be found hereLinks to an external site.. More detailed scope specifications are provided in individual project milestones on Canvas.

Front-end: an Android/Kotlin mobile application

Must run natively on Android (not in a browser).
Must run on at least one real device and on a Pixel 7 emulator running Android Tiramisu (API 33).
Must be written natively in Kotlin. 
Using other frameworks, e.g., Expo, ReactNative, Xamarin, Flutter, etc. is not permitted.
Must use Jetpack Compose (rather than Views) for Android UI.
Back-end: a Node.js/TypeScript server

Must run on Node.js
Must be implemented in TypeScript
If your back-end uses a database, you may choose between MySQL and MongoDB. 
Must be deployed on a cloud (AWS, Azure, Google, IBM, etc.)
The back-end must be up and running when grading is conducted. 
Most vendors, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM, provide free student/newcomer subscriptions.
The course staff also secured a limited number of pre-paid subscriptions to Microsoft Azure. To receive an allocation, please send a request to the instructors on Piazza with the title “Azure Access Request - Individual” (for M1) and “Azure Access Request - Group” (for all other milestones). In the body of the message, list (a) your first name, (b) your last name, and (c) your Microsoft account id, if available, or your UBC email, if no account is yet created, which will become your account id. If it is for a group project, list the information (a)(b)(c) of each group member, and (d) your project name. 
Please note that no credit will be applied retroactively and no refunds can be made for money paid. 
Using third-party libraries, services, and frameworks:

You should implement the major functionalities of your project using Kotlin for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.
Using third-party services, such as Firebase, MongoDB Atlas, Realm, AWS Amplify, Azure Functions and App Service, Azure Supabase, Parse Platform, etc., to implement major project functionality, e.g., database management, authentication, and critical application operations, is strictly forbidden.
An exception to this rule is Firebase's push notification support, which is required and permitted.
If you plan to use any third-party library or service not listed here to support a major functionality of your project, please check with the instructors beforehand, to make sure the use of the specific library is allowed and the functionality will be considered as part of your work. 
Examples of the libraries/frameworks that were permitted in the past (and do not require an additional approval) can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cz-UIpMLJYtjjR11V8SGYnLVf5yvEJLo9gelDcNCF-Y/edit?usp=sharingLinks to an external site.
Code review and testing tools:

The following tools will be used for automated code review and testing of your projects. While your are not required to use these tools prior to M4, it is a good idea to explore how to integrate them into your development pipeline early on, e.g., the automated code review tool, so you write clean code from the start.  

Codacy (https://www.codacy.com/) – an automated code review tool.
Specific instructions on how to configure the tool for Kotlin and TypeScript checks will be available in M4.
Jest (https://jestjs.io) – a testing framework for TypeScript.
Jetpack Compose Testing APIs (https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing) – a testing framework for Android Compose screens and components.
UI Automator (https://developer.android.com/training/testing/other-components/ui-automator) – a testing framework for Android cross-app functional UI (to perform operations such as opening the Settings menu or the app launcher on a test device).
GitHub Actions (https://docs.github.com/en/actions) – an automated continuous integration pipeline.
Front-end and back-end tutorials: Introduction videos for front-end and back-end development are available on Canvas.

Code Management:

All development artifacts must be stored in GitHub - a popular platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control using Git.
All code of each project (front-end and back-end) should be stored in one GitHub repository
Well-structured internally
Yes, you can make it work in one repository! https://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-2-billion-lines-codeand-one-place/Links to an external site.
Your repository should be public (to use various free GitHub services later on). If you make your repository private, you might need to pay for some services. No funding will be provided.
If you do not want to use your GitHub account, feel free to create a throw-away/anonymous GitHub account for this course.
You must give all TAs explicit write access to your repository (even if you make it public). The GitHub IDs of the TAs are: @MasihbrLinks to an external site., @fattemeLinks to an external site., @dorawyyLinks to an external site.. 
Use the Atlassian Git IntroductionLinks to an external site., which can get you started with Git. A shorter, less formal, guideLinks to an external site. is also available.
Milestones and Deliverables: The course project has multiple milestones, which are described in the Grading section. The detailed specification for each milestone deliverable is attached to the Canvas assignment. The milestone submission schedule is also outlined in the Course Schedule table.

Project Groups: Besides the first milestone, the project is implemented in groups of 4 students.

Use Piazza “Search for Teammates” page to find team members.
Choose your team members wisely as they contribute to the success of your team; no changes will be permitted.
If you do not have a team organized by the Tuesday, September 16, 3pm PT deadline, we will assign you to a team randomly.
We will “fill up” all teams to have 4 members, potentially “breaking” teams of 3 or less to multiple teams.
